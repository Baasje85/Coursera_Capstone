However, starting one might not be the biggest challenge. In a place like Rome there are assumed to be pizzerias on about every corner of every busy street. The competition is huge if not killing or completely murderous.\n\nI have been contacted by a pizza lover who wants to know if (and if so, then where) there is still room for a new pizzeria in the city of Rome. This pizza lover is aching to start his own pizza place in the best part of the city, however, he knows there is a lot of competition. He asked me to investigate where he stands the most chance of getting his new restaurant running, i.e. where the competition is the least \u2018killing\u2019 and people are still willing to try out his pizzas."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "  "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "In order to answer the main question: Is there still room for a new pizzeria in the city of Rome, Italy, subdivisions (municipio) of Rome were scraped from wikipedia.org (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_subdivision_of_Rome). This scraping resulted in a dataframe containing the names of the fifteen municipio, their corresponding population, area in square kilometers and density in square kilometers. In addition, the coordinates of the different municipio were collected from www.geonames.org. A csv-file was manually created with the corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates of each municipio (all were positioned on different pages on the site).\n\nData was further pre-processed merging both the dataframe containing the information from wikipedia.org and the manually created csv-file with information from geonames.org.\n\nThe municipio of Rome were labeled on a map, showing their positions in the city.\n\nWith the use of the Foursquare API the venues of the fifteen municipio were explored per subdivision (within a range of 1500 meters from the coordinates of the subdivision, with a limit of 100 venues). The resulting venues were filtered, leaving anything out except for the categories 'pizza place' and 'Italian restaurant'. For every subdivision of the city, this resulted in a dataframe containing the pizza places and Italian restaurants.\n\nIn order to come up with a meaningful answer to the main question, the number of relevant venues in each municipio were combined into a new dataframe. The population density was taken into account during the search for the best place for a new pizzeria. Municipio containing the lowest 'competitors' in combination with the highest population density were considered to be the 'place to be' for a new pizzeria.\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.8", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
